The V-ROOM Team mainly uses this game engine to build the virtual environment for our virtual classrooms and more! Getting Started To get started with Unity, you should install it on your machine. See below for the version that we are using! Download Unity Editor 2019.4.8f1 2019.4.31f Download version 2019.4.8f1 Get on hub 64-bit Download version 2019.4.31f1 Get on hub 64-bit Info Since I'm using a operating system, this tutorial will show the process in computer. If you are using , the process should be similar, but if there's anything you're not sure about, Google is your friend! Installation Walkthrough There are two ways to install Unity on your machine: via Unity Hub or Standalone install . Unity Hub Installing through Unity Hub is the most recommended method as it is simple and straightforward! You need to have Unity Hub installed to proceed. Unity Hub requires internet connection to download the Editor files for installation Open Unity Hub Navigate to the Installs tab on the left Click on Add button to add the version of Unity Editor that you need. Select the version that you need ( 2019.4.8f1 ) Click next . Now select all the modules that you need. See the table below to see which modules you need to develop each platform PC VR HoloLens Android Windows Build Support Universal Windows Build Platform Android Build Support Tip We highly recommend you to also install Microsoft Visual Studio Community .

You can add modules from the editor by clicking on the button and select Add Modules Standalone Installation The standalone installation is typically used when you can't find the Unity version you need since it might already been replaced by a new version or when there are issues with installing using the Unity Hub. This includes: Going to Archive Downloading an executable installer .exe ( ) / .dmg ( ) Installing Unity Editor Locating the editor on Unity Hub Note You still need to have Unity Hub already installed on your machine, since we're going to locate the installed editor on the Hub.

You can select Unity Hub to install the archived versions on Unity Hub instead of downloading a separate executable installer. It's less hassle, really! Visit the Unity Archive So you have decided to standalone install Unity Editor, great! The first thing to do is to go to the archive and select your version. Visit Unity Archive Download Unity Installer for the version you need ( 2019.4.8f1 ).

Follow the instruction on screen. Choose where you want to install it. Once finished you have successfully installed the editor. Locating on Unity Hub Now, you need to locate the newly installed editor on Unity Hub. Open Unity Hub and navigate to the Installs section click on Locate .
